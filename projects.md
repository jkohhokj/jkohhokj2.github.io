Got bored during a social event so decided to climb trees, also got my friends to bandwagon with me.

## Lifting (April 2022 - present): <a name="Lifting"></a>

> Weight training is a common type of strength training for developing the strength, size of skeletal muscles and maintenance of strength. It uses the force of gravity in the form of weighted bars, dumbbells or weight stacks in order to oppose the force generated by muscle through concentric or eccentric contraction.

As of 10/31/2022 stats: 

Deadlift: 315

Squat: 295

Bench: 205

Most recent recording of my deadlift, 295 lbs.

## Robotics (Late 2021 - present): <a name="Robotics"></a>

> Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of computer science and engineering. Robotics involves design, construction, operation, and use of robots. The goal of robotics is to design machines that can help and assist humans.

I initially had zero interest in participating in robotics until a friend dragged me into one of the meetings with the promise of food to be the lead programmer as I had a strong background in software. While I wasn't "hooked" I *was* somewhat intrigued in building cool stuff so I agreed to keep coming back to meetings. I had a very naive outlook on how coding could affect the very limited API of the VEX robot (especially in the 2021-2022 season of Tipping Point) but as I gradually explored this niche, I discovered more naunce in this project, eventually stumbling across the entire field of industrial control systems. With my interest peaking through competition, I spent hundreds of hours over the course of my first season with my team, making our way to the international stage at VEX Worlds in Dallas, TX. Overall, this was amazing experience and had a great time with my friends which can basically be summarized with one graph.

![Robotics.mp4](/assets/robotics3.png)

And the reason why Justin's expectations skyrocketed in the first competition was because of this (we're Vipers) even though that was completely because of luck 
T-T.

![Robotics.mp5](/assets/robotics4.png)

As the season concluded, I created the [DeBakey VRC website](https://debakeyvrc.github.io/) to document our progress to attract incoming freshmen to our club (and convince admins to adequately fund us lol). I learned a lot about industrial control systems, C++ STL, mechnical design, electronics, and mechanical engineering throughout this journey and hope to bring back a trophy in Worlds next season. :p

And while the 2021-2022 season had limited programmer involvement, it looks like this season's game, [Spin Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIZgvVDZc2Y), will definitely allow me to go all out on the programming which is exciting (and pressuring ðŸ˜–).

## OSU!game (Late 2021 - present): <a name="OSU!"></a>

> osu! is a free-to-play rhythm game

I've been playing OSU! since September 2021 and my profile can be found [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/25738797). This isn't really an accomplishment I just felt like putting it here. :D

## Embedded Hacking and Reverse Engineering (Early 2021 - present): <a name="Embedded"></a>

> Embedded systems security is a cybersecurity field focused on preventing malicious access to and use of embedded systems.

> The process of taking a piece of software or hardware and analyzing its functions and information flow so that its functionality and behavior can be understood. Malware is commonly reverse-engineered in cyber defense.

Most [CTFs](#CTFs) are structured into 5 distinct categories, web, pwn, crypto, forensics/misc, and reversing, of which I chose reverse engineering to be my specialty. Because of my informal learning style I just learned from whatever resources I could find, even though they were probably not targeted towards my direct interest, they still did provide suplemental value. Most of the theoretical reversing I've learned comes from [Reverse_Engineering-Wiley(2005)](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Reversing%3A+Secrets+of+Reverse+Engineering+-p-9781118079768) which goes over Assembly, computer architecture, and a variety of reversing topics.

In addition to my self-learning, I also participated in the Embedded Security and Hardware Hacking course from MIT's Lincoln Lab at [BWSI](/events#mit-beaverworks-2022). During this course, I learned more about the finer details of cryptographic vulnerabilities, low level computer programming, and a more formal approach to the embedded design process. The final design project of our class being an exciting A/D (attack and defense) style CTF competition where teams of 4 students wrote bootloader and utility programs that could remotely update an embedded system while other teams tried to exploit vulnerabilities in their code and hack their systems.

Here are examples of some of the reverse engineering CTF challenges I've written: [RollingOnMyOwn](/assets/Rolling On My Own/) and [SlowMaffs](/assets/SlowMaffs - Rev) for [idekCTF 2021](/events.md#idekctf-2021-2021) and [Digital Overdose Autumn 2021](https://ctftime.org/event/1459), respectively.

Here are some of the writeups for challenges I've solved through my CTF career: [some basic static analysis chall](https://github.com/jkohhokj/jkohhokj.github.io/blob/main/assets/writeups/loading.md), [insecure AES implementation chall](https://github.com/jkohhokj/jkohhokj.github.io/blob/main/assets/writeups/lupus.md), [keygen chall](https://github.com/jkohhokj/jkohhokj.github.io/blob/main/assets/writeups/sanity.md), [low level algo chall](https://github.com/jkohhokj/jkohhokj.github.io/blob/main/assets/writeups/sub.md), and a [tutorial chall](https://github.com/jkohhokj/jkohhokj.github.io/blob/main/assets/writeups/Walkthrough%20of%20Intro%20to%20Ghidra.md).

I even wrote a little [guide](/assets/Rev.md) on getting started on CTF reversing :p

## Maps of Meaning/Personality (Early 2021): <a name="Psych"></a>

> Maps of Meaning lays bare the grammar of mythology, and describes the relevance of that grammar for interpretation of narrative and religion, comprehension of ideological identification, and understanding of the role that individual choice plays in the maintenance, transformation and destiny of social systems.

[Course page](https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/classes/psychology-434/) and [YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8Xc2_FtpHI&list=PL22J3VaeABQAT-0aSPq-OKOpQlHyR4k5h)

> Personality is a way of looking at the world, and a characteristic mode of behaving. It's both stable and adaptively dynamic. 

[Course page](https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/classes/personality-and-its-transformations/) and [YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM&list=PL22J3VaeABQApSdW8X71Ihe34eKN6XhCi)

The lecture series "2017 Maps of Meaning" is a 4th year, 12-video lecture series for psychology students from the University of Toronto by Jordan Peterson based on his book titled "Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief." In accordance with finishing the entire course over the summer of 2021 when I literally had nothing better to do, I had compiled about 50 full pages (25,170 words) worth of notes and introspection. This lecture course adapted the Jungian and Freudian perspectives of psychology regarding cultural archetypes with the new advancement in neuroscience and biology and has **largely** shaped my viewpoint on how cultures and individuals interplay with reality on a metaphysical and physiological level. Below I have compiled some of the recurrent themes (and their complement) that I've interpreted from the lecture.

Essential themes:
 - Order and Chaos/Masculinity and Femininity
 - Responsibility and Rights => Individual and Government
 - Subjectivity and Objectivity
 - Tyranny and Justice
 - Enlightenment and Ignorance
 - Frames of reference and Hierarchy
 - Nihilism and Hedonism

"2017 Personality and its Transformation" is a lecture series for 2nd year psychology students at UoT also by Professor Peterson which describes the different modes of being in the world. Again, I have finished the entire course with roughly 40 full pages (20,370 words) of notes after I had finished the Maps of Meaning lecture series. This class was more based in the biological perspective of psychology and brought the context into the current political and social environment, compared to the abstracted "collective unconscious" Maps of Meaning was based on. As a side note, throughout both of these classes, I've realized that my notes have significantly improved in quality because of the new method I tried out. Additionally, I've found a lot of great readings from writers such as Orwell and Solzhenitsyn. 

I've always found it difficult to integrate this aspect of my life when representing myself like writing my resume and simply answering the question "What have you done/accomplished?" because the philosophical and psychological knowledge can't be as directly expressed as some of my other interests and tend to be overshadowed by the more tangible, immediately recognizable achievements.

## CTFs/Hacking (Late 2020 - present): <a name="CTFs"></a>

> Hacking refers to activities that seek to compromise digital devices, such as computers, smartphones, tablets, and even entire networks.

> Capture the Flag (CTF) is a special kind of information security competitions. CTF games often touch on many other aspects of information security: cryptography, digital forensics, reverse engineering, binary exploitation, and website security.

My first piece of exposure to the hacking community was through a [14 hour video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Kq1MIfTWCE) by TheCyberMentor about [penetration testing](https://www.coresecurity.com/penetration-testing#:~:text=A%20penetration%20test%2C%20or%20pen,or%20risky%20end%2Duser%20behavior.). Being bored in quarantine and through the struggles of online school, this video immediately captivated my attention and I was completely absorbed with the idea of being able to see a world of vulnerabilities in a world where people naturally assumed absolute security. The fundamental understanding of how we interacted with our digital reality opened up an undiscovered realm of possibilities, a revelation that fascinated me. I scrambled to learn as much as I could about this new culture, pouring hundreds of hours into listening to talks, watching videos, reading books, and consuming as much information from whatever else I could get my hands on. I also took some notes on the resources I devoured, some of which I actually managed to salvage in [The Web Application Hackers Handbook](/assets/WebAppNotes.md) and [Penetration Testing - A hands-on introduction to Hacking](PenetrationTestingNotes.md). I was interested in taking courses on the major hacking certificates like the OSCP and CEH, even seriously considering just not bothering with university and just going into industry with one of these certificates at one point. Eventually, I found the world of CTFs and competition...

For the layman, CTFs are basically what you think of when the phrase "Facebook underground hacking tournament" comes up, though, like most things in life, less romanticized. In March of 2021 I played my first ever CTF, picoCTF 2021 with a group of friends I found online. With my intial delve into cybersecurity, I had come in with the expectations of being able to compete with the best, but this competition, targeted at high schoolers humbled me. After that I decided to take this whole CTF thing more seriously, co-founding the CTF team idek (originally "idk", but that was taken on CTFtime, the leaderboards for all CTFs). Our team played almost every weekend, eventually climbing the ranks and inviting more experienced players to compete on our team, ending the 2021 season at 4th in the US and 31st in the world. In addition to competiting, we also hosted our very first CTF competition [idekCTF 2021](https://ctftime.org/event/1512) with overwhelmingly positive results. The next year, we peaked at 1st globally, though shortly after I left because I didn't feel like I could contribute significantly enough to justify my stay. Personally, I learned a lot of reverse engineering skills (my specialty in competition) and met a lot of amazing people but probably more importantly, how to coordinate and organize events on an international scale.

While I still play CTFs occasionally, this isn't my focus in life anymore and though sometimes I wonder what life would have become if I stayed on the team and perhaps let go of my ego in trying to learn/imposter syndrome, I've accepted my decision and am purusing other venues in life. Though recently I played under the team "Caliente" in picoCTF 2022, the largest high school CTF competition in the world, and won 9th place, receiving some cool swag from the organizers. :D

Update: I joined idek again but play less of a leadership role than before and it's a healthier relationship now.

A couple more honorable mentions that I did during this tedious, stressful CTF journey was partnering with other online cybersecurity communities, founding idekJT, a junior team for funneling top talent into the main team lol, writing a basic [guide](https://github.com/idekctf/idekctf.github.io/blob/main/Resources/BabyRev.md) to CTF reverse engineering, and seeking out sponsorships for idekCTF 2021 (as well as writing my own challenges of course).

## Language Acquisition (Late 2019 - present): <a name="Language"></a>

> Language Learning refers to learning about a language, its sound system, its structure. It is largely an intellectual exercise. Language acquisition means somehow absorbing a target language's sound system and structure, ideally without ever thinking explicitly about the language's actual structure.

I've always been intrigued with how people communicate with each other from the subtle social cues to the heartfelt abstractions of emotion. I wanted to learn the nuances of expression and how different cultures viewed their geography and society. With a new way of intepreting reality, comes a new identity, a new duality of cultures. Language acquisition helped me reflect on my own thoughts and how I presented myself to other people. Growing up in a bilingual household, I've forged my identity on being able to understand 2 languages, but every time I go back to Singapore, I'm brutally reminded of how hopeless my Chinese is T^T. Because of this, I began using Anki to try and advance my language comprehension studying mainly from the HSK Level 4 and 5 vocab words.

Around the beginning of high school, I started watching a lot of anime (my favorite is Seishun Buta Yarou) and along with this came an influx of a new culture. I was motivated to learn Japanese mostly because I wanted to understand the raw culture being expressed from private and public formalities to interpretations of character development, not to mention Japanese sounds nice. But what truly separates language learning from langauge acquisition is the other aspects of culture. As I tried to understand this other world, I explored other aspects of Japanese culture from music, writings, religion, and of course my favorite, food. I mainly used LingoDeer to learn new words and Anki for reinforcement memorization, the total hours of my Japanese learning must be well over 200, but with no record of it, I'm not entirely sure. I studied about halfway through JLPT n4 for reference on my comprehension. I also briefly studied Russian and Korean however I never really got further than simply learning the alphabet.

<img src="/assets/lingodeer.png" alt="lingodeer" width="300"/>
Some random picture I found from the app I used to study Japanese which is now unfortunately the only statistic I have left from the app. I'm confident that the total number of hours exceeded well over 100 when I stopped.

![pic](/assets/anki.png)
Here is the overview of the number of reviews on Anki I have for Japanese and Chinese, mostly during the summer when I had more free time; during schooltime I preferred LingoDeer because it was mobile.


## Running (Late 2019 - present): <a name="Running"></a>

> Jogging is a form of trotting or running at a slow or leisurely pace. The main intention is to increase physical fitness with less stress on the body than from faster running but more than walking, or to maintain a steady speed for longer periods of time.

Through the later years of middle school into high school I've used running as a way to stay physically active. My main goal during this period of time was to increase my pace over the 1 mile distance, however without properly training advice or coaching my progress did not match up with my expections. During this time, my weekly mileage was somewhere around 10 miles. But over time, my interest and drive to run faster gradually dwindled, eventually having lackluster motivation to even put on my shoes. During the summer of 2022, I found rejuvenated motivated in running for the Houston Cheveron Marathon in 2023. So naturally, I began training for this epic race by increasing mileage. I also realized I had to work on my breathwork by switching from naturally mouth breathing to nose breathing.

Through running, I found a way to temporarily escape the drudgery of life by focusing on nothing but making it to the next mile. I felt this helping me release my anxiety by giving me an avenue to stress my body and letting my mind relax. 

My early years of running:

which transitioned into something more like this:

## Calisthenics (2018 - present): <a name="Calisthenics"></a>

> Calisthenics is a form of strength training consisting of a variety of movements that exercise large muscle groups. These exercises are often performed rhythmically and with minimal equipment, as bodyweight exercises.

I have been interested in calisthenics, and just staying athletic in general, ever since I was a child because that's how I perceived a healthy lifestyle. I played badminton competitively at a local level (about 2018-2020) which applied many of the concepts of bodyweight exercises in the training such as the basic push ups, crunches, squats, and pull ups. However, as quarantine hit, I had stopped training and began to decline in physical health from not going out and focusing most of my time studying CTFs and hacking. Because of this, over the summer of 2022 I began seriously working out again and picking up the remenants of the athletic abilities I had before. After thoroughly researching weightlifting and calisthenics techniques (and being a nerd by applying physics to calisthenics skills T-T) I finally fell into a solid groove of getting stronger and practicing these skills.

Maybe I'll put some pics and do some sort of progress update sooner or later.

## Programming (2017 - present): <a name="Programming"></a>

> Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

I began my coding career with the stereotypical idea of trying to program games, first using C#, later transitioning to Python because of its more extensive framework. The [games repo](https://github.com/jkohhokj/Games) on my Github has a few of the archived games I've programmed ranging from Hangman to Tetris to Snake. There's also this one project that I technically haven't finished which is a physics engine that currently only simulates basic linear collisions with mass and momentum.  

Through this journey, I learned about game design and up to the intermediate level of coding paradigms, ultimately the main focus of my career pursuits nowadays. I cannot emphasize enough how much learning programming at this age has provided me with the foundation that I apply for basically everything I'm interested in now. From around 2019-2020 I also began touching on other subjects in software engineering such as machine learning/AI in my [MachineLearning repo](https://github.com/jkohhokj/Games/tree/master/MachineLearning-LanguageProcessing), Python's REST APIs in the [PCPP repo](https://github.com/jkohhokj/Games/tree/master/PCPP301), and worked with the other major general programming languages like Java, JavaScript, and C. Maybe in the future I'll learn platform specific languages like Objective-C, Swift, or TypeScript but for now, I have most of the knowledge I'll need for my endeavors.

## Honorable Mentions: <a name="Honorables"></a>

I've begun to work/study on these but haven't had any "results" yet so these are only honorable mentions.

[NACLO](https://nacloweb.org/) (North American Computational Olympiad) looks like a fun science olympiad that doesn't require too much memorization.

[IOAA](https://www.ioaastrophysics.org/) (International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics) 

[USACO](http://www.usaco.org/) (USA Coding Olympiad) would be a great way for me to apply my software engineering-esque skills with algorithms and data structures.
