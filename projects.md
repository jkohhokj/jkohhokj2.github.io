## Robotics (Late 2021 - present): <a name="Robotics"></a>

> Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of computer science and engineering. Robotics involves design, construction, operation, and use of robots. The goal of robotics is to design machines that can help and assist humans.

I initially had zero interest in participating in robotics until a friend dragged me into one of the meetings with the promise of food to be the lead programmer as I had a strong background in software. While I wasn't "hooked" I *was* somewhat intrigued in building cool stuff so I agreed to keep coming back to meetings. I had a very naive outlook on how coding could affect the very limited API of the VEX robot (especially in the 2021-2022 season of Tipping Point) but as I gradually explored this niche, I discovered more naunce in this project, eventually stumbling across the entire field of industrial control systems. With my interest peaking through competition, I spent hundreds of hours over the course of my first season with my team, making our way to the international stage at VEX Worlds in Dallas, TX. Overall, this was amazing experience and had a great time with my friends which can basically be summarized with one graph.

And the reason why Justin's expectations skyrocketed in the first competition was because of this (we're Vipers) even though that was completely because of luck 
T-T.

As the season concluded, I created the [DeBakey VRC website](https://debakeyvrc.github.io/) to document our progress to attract incoming freshmen to our club (and convince admins to adequately fund us lol). I learned a lot about industrial control systems, C++ STL, mechnical design, electronics, and mechanical engineering throughout this journey and hope to bring back a trophy in Worlds next season. :p

And while the 2021-2022 season had limited programmer involvement, it looks like this season's game, [Spin Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIZgvVDZc2Y), will definitely allow me to go all out on the programming which is exciting (and pressuring ðŸ˜–).

## OSU!game (Late 2021 - present): <a name="OSU!"></a>

> osu! is a free-to-play rhythm game

I've been playing OSU! since September 2021 and my profile can be found [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/25738797). This isn't really an accomplishment I just felt like putting it here. :D

## Maps of Meaning/Personality (Early 2021): <a name="Psych"></a>

> Maps of Meaning lays bare the grammar of mythology, and describes the relevance of that grammar for interpretation of narrative and religion, comprehension of ideological identification, and understanding of the role that individual choice plays in the maintenance, transformation and destiny of social systems.

> Personality is a way of looking at the world, and a characteristic mode of behaving. It's both stable and adaptively dynamic. 

[Course page](https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/classes/personality-and-its-transformations/) and [YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM&list=PL22J3VaeABQApSdW8X71Ihe34eKN6XhCi)

The lecture series "2017 Maps of Meaning" is a 4th year, 12-video lecture series for psychology students from the University of Toronto by Jordan Peterson based on his book titled "Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief." In accordance with finishing the entire course over the summer of 2021 when I literally had nothing better to do, I had compiled about 50 full pages (25,170 words) worth of notes and introspection. This lecture course adapted the Jungian and Freudian perspectives of psychology regarding cultural archetypes with the new advancement in neuroscience and biology and has **largely** shaped my viewpoint on how cultures and individuals interplay with reality on a metaphysical and physiological level. Below I have compiled some of the recurrent themes (and their complement) that I've interpreted from the lecture.

Essential themes:
 - Order and Chaos/Masculinity and Femininity
 - Responsibility and Rights => Individual and Government
 - Subjectivity and Objectivity
 - Tyranny and Justice
 - Enlightenment and Ignorance
 - Frames of reference and Hierarchy
 - Nihilism and Hedonism

"2017 Personality and its Transformation" is a lecture series for 2nd year psychology students at UoT also by Professor Peterson which describes the different modes of being in the world. Again, I have finished the entire course with roughly 40 full pages (20,370 words) of notes after I had finished the Maps of Meaning lecture series. This class was more based in the biological perspective of psychology and brought the context into the current political and social environment, compared to the abstracted "collective unconscious" Maps of Meaning was based on. As a side note, throughout both of these classes, I've realized that my notes have significantly improved in quality because of the new method I tried out. Additionally, I've found a lot of great readings from writers such as Orwell and Solzhenitsyn. 

I've always found it difficult to integrate this aspect of my life when representing myself like writing my resume and simply answering the question "What have you done/accomplished?" because the philosophical and psychological knowledge can't be as directly expressed as some of my other interests and tend to be overshadowed by the more tangible, immediately recognizable achievements.

## CTFs (Late 2020 - present): <a name="CTFs"></a>

> Capture the Flag (CTF) is a special kind of information security competitions. CTF games often touch on many other aspects of information security: cryptography, digital forensics, reverse engineering, binary exploitation, and website security.

For the layman, CTFs are basically what you think of when the phrase "Facebook underground hacking tournament" comes up, though, like most things in life, less romanticized. In March of 2021 I played my first ever CTF, picoCTF 2021 with a group of friends I found online. I had done some initial research on informations security topics like Metasploit and the CEH certificate, but this competition, targetted at high schoolers allowed me to practically apply my perceived skills (I say perceived because I didn't do well lol). After that I decided to take this whole hacking thing more seriously, co-founding the CTF idek (originally "idk", but that was taken on CTFtime, the leaderboards for all CTFs). Our team played almost every weekend, eventually climbing the ranks and inviting more experienced players to compete on our team, ending the 2021 season at 4th in the US and 31st in the world. In addition to competiting, we also hosted our very first CTF competition [idekCTF 2021](https://ctftime.org/event/1512) with overwhelmingly positive results. The next year, we peaked at 1st globally, though shortly after I left because I didn't feel like I could contribute significantly enough to justify my stay. Personally, I learned a lot of reverse engineering skills (my specialty in competition) and met a lot of amazing people but probably more importantly, how to coordinate and organize events on a global scale.

While I still play CTFs occasionally, this isn't my focus in life anymore and though sometimes I wonder what life would have become if I stayed on the team and perhaps let go of my ego in trying to learn/imposter syndrome, I've accepted my decision and am purusing other venues in life. Though recently I played under the team "Caliente" in picoCTF 2022, the largest high school CTF competition in the world, and won 9th place, receiving some cool swag from the organizers. :D

A couple more honorable mentions that I did during this tedious, stressful CTF journey was partnering with other online cybersecurity communities, founding idekJT, a junior team for funneling top talent into the main team lol, writing a basic [guide](https://github.com/idekctf/idekctf.github.io/blob/main/Resources/BabyRev.md) to CTF reverse engineering, and seeking out sponsorships for idekCTF 2021 (as well as writing my own challenges of course).

## Calisthenics (2018 - present): <a name="Calisthenics"></a>

> Calisthenics is a form of strength training consisting of a variety of movements that exercise large muscle groups. These exercises are often performed rhythmically and with minimal equipment, as bodyweight exercises.

I have been interested in calisthenics, and just staying athletic in general, ever since I was a child because that's how I perceived a healthy lifestyle. I played badminton competitively at a local level (about 2018-2020) which applied many of the concepts of bodyweight exercises in the training such as the basic push ups, crunches, squats, and pull ups. However, as quarantine hit, I had stopped training and began to decline in physical health from not going out and focusing most of my time studying CTFs and hacking. Because of this, over the summer of 2022 I began seriously working out again and picking up the remenants of the athletic abilities I had before. After thoroughly researching weightlifting and calisthenics techniques (and being a nerd by applying physics to calisthenics skills T-T) I finally fell into a solid groove of getting stronger and practicing these skills.

Maybe I'll put some pics and do some sort of progress update sooner or later.

## Programming (2017 - present): <a name="Programming"></a>

> Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

I began my coding career with the stereotypical idea of trying to program games, first using C#, later transitioning to Python because of its more extensive framework. The [games repo](https://github.com/jkohhokj/Games) on my Github has a few of the archived games I've programmed ranging from Hangman to Tetris to Snake. There's also this one project that I technically haven't finished which is a physics engine that currently only simulates basic linear collisions with mass and momentum.  

Through this journey, I learned about game design and up to the intermediate level of coding paradigms, ultimately the main focus of my career pursuits nowadays. I cannot emphasize enough how much learning programming at this age has provided me with the foundation that I apply for basically everything I'm interested in now. From around 2019-2020 I also began touching on other subjects in software engineering such as machine learning/AI in my [MachineLearning repo](https://github.com/jkohhokj/Games/tree/master/MachineLearning-LanguageProcessing), Python's REST APIs in the [PCPP repo](https://github.com/jkohhokj/Games/tree/master/PCPP301), and worked with the other major general programming languages like Java, JavaScript, and C. Maybe in the future I'll learn platform specific languages like Objective-C, Swift, or TypeScript but for now, I have most of the knowledge I'll need for my endeavors.

## Honorable Mentions: <a name="Honorables"></a>

I've begun to work/study on these but haven't had any "results" yet so these are only honorable mentions.

[NACLO](https://nacloweb.org/) (North American Computational Olympiad) looks like a fun science olympiad that doesn't require too much memorization.

[IOAA](https://www.ioaastrophysics.org/) (International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics) 

[USACO](http://www.usaco.org/) (USA Coding Olympiad) would be a great way for me to apply my software engineering-esque skills with algorithms and data structures.

Running is something I've done on and off throughout my life as a way to stay active, but recently I wanted to take this training a little more seriously, aiming for the Houston Marathon in January.
