# Projects

Here are some of the projects/hobbies I've been working on over the years:

## Robotics (2021 - present):

I initially had zero interest in participating in robotics until a friend dragged me into one of the meetings with the promise of food to be the lead programmer as I had a strong background in software. While I wasn't "hooked" I *was* somewhat intruiged in building cool stuff so I agreed to keep coming back to meetings. I had a very naive outlook on how coding could affect the very limited API of the VEX robot (especially in the 2021-2022 season of Tipping Point) and as I gradually explored this niche, I discovered the entire field of industry control systems. With my interest peaking through competition, I spent hundreds of hours over the course of my first season with my team and had a great time, making our way to the international stage at VEX Worlds in Dallas, TX. 

As the season concluded, I created the [DeBakey VRC website](https://debakeyvrc.github.io/) to document our progress to attract incoming freshmen to our club (and convince admins to adequately fund us lol). I learned a lot of industrial control systems, C++, mechnical design, eletronics, and engineering throughout this journey and hope to bring back a trophy in Worlds next season. :p

And while the 2021-2022 season had limited programmer involvement, it looks like this season's game, [Spin Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIZgvVDZc2Y), will definitely allow me to go all out on the programming which is exciting (and pressuring :confounded: ).

## OSU!game (2021 - present):

## CTFs (2020 - present):

## Calisthenics (2020 - present):

## Programming (2017 - present):

I began my coding career with the stereotypical idea of trying to program games, first using C#, later transitioning to Python because of its more extensive framework. The [games repo](https://github.com/jkohhokj/Games) on my Github has a few of the archived games I've programmed ranging from Hangman to Tetris to Snake. There's also this one project that I technically haven't finished which is a physics engine that currently only simulates basic linear collisions with mass and momentum.  

Through this journey, I learned about game design and up to the intermediate level of coding paradigms, ultimately the main focus of my career pursuits nowadays. From around 2019-2020 I also began touching on other subjects in software engineering such as machine learning/AI in my [MachineLearning repo](https://github.com/jkohhokj/Games/tree/master/MachineLearning-LanguageProcessing), Python's REST APIs in the [PCPP repo](https://github.com/jkohhokj/Games/tree/master/PCPP301), and worked with the other major general programming languages like Java, JavaScript, and C.

### Honorable Mentions:

I've begun to work/study on these but haven't had any "results" yet so these are only honorable mentions.

[NACLO](https://nacloweb.org/) (North American Computational Olympiad) looks like a fun science olympiad that doesn't require too much memorization.

[IOAA](https://www.ioaastrophysics.org/) (International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics) 

[USACO](http://www.usaco.org/) (USA Coding Olympiad) would be a great way for me to apply my software engineering-esque skills with algorithms and data structures.

Running is something I've done on and off throughout my life as a way to stay active, but recently I wanted to take this training a little more seriously, aiming for the Houston Marathon in January.
