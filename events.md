## MIT BeaverWorks Internship (2023)

> Summer Program hosted by MIT's Lincoln Lab for teaching high schoolers advanced computer science topics

Over the summer, MIT's Lincoln Lab hosts a 4 week summer program called BeaverWorks Summer Institute (BWSI) that teaches high schoolers industry level technical skills. I had the opportunity to design and teach the Embedded Security and Hardware Hacking course, a course I had previously attended as a student, now as a TA. Under the guidance of MITRE teachers (praise Iv Robinson orz) we taught our students how to design and deploy a firmware updating protocol for an offsite bootloader. After deployment, we hide flags in the hardware and held a competition for whichever team could capture the most flags using commonly exploited vulnerabilites in the real world like booting maclious firmware, finding the encrpytion key, and dumping flash memory. Teaching students allowed me to take a step back and experience the course from the perspective of someone who didn't intuitively understand these technical concepts and taught me to analyze and teach complex problems in a more human-intuitive sense. I also learned to recognize when students were struggling but weren't comfortable asking for help.
