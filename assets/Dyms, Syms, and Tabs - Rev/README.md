## Description

I don't remember what my C file name was before I compiled it!! Help me recover the file name of the source code for this file :O
You have to manually add the DO{} flag wrapper without the FILE EXTENSION or that would be too easy ;) 

## Distribution

- `chall`

## Deploy notes

- downloadable file

## Solution

Read the Dynamic Symbols Table and grep for ABSolute to find the original file name
